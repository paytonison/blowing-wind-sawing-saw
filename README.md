## Summary
*When the Wind Blows the Saw Moves* is a confused and self-indulgent piece that fails to function as a short story. It reads like an excerpt torn from a larger manuscript, lazily leaning on religious symbolism and emotional shorthand in place of real character development or narrative structure. The story attempts to chart a protagonist’s moral descent through three "steps" toward the death of his soul, but this framework feels forced and unearned. Rather than letting the events naturally unfold, the author imposes a heavy-handed arc that feels more like a pitch for a tragic character study than an actual one.

The emotional weight of the story hinges on the deaths of the protagonist’s mother and lover, but both characters are more symbolic than human. The mother is reduced to a moral mouthpiece obsessed with tulips and Catholic metaphors, and Farla, who begins with some semblance of agency, quickly devolves into a plot device whose off-page demise is used purely to justify the protagonist’s spiral. Her relationship with Charles is left deliberately ambiguous, not for nuance, but seemingly to avoid committing to real conflict or exploring difficult emotional territory.

The prose is overly ornate, cluttered with imagery that tries to compensate for the lack of narrative momentum. Dialogue often feels stilted or theatrical, more concerned with delivering thematic declarations than sounding like real people talking. Charles, in particular, is cartoonishly villainous—an archetype without complexity, reduced to a foil for the protagonist’s descent into pseudo-righteous vengeance. His final scene, strapped to a sawmill table, is absurdly theatrical and undermines whatever emotional tension the story tried to build. It’s hard to care when everything feels like overwrought stagecraft.

Worse still, the story evades resolution. The protagonist’s choice to indirectly kill his brother via wind-powered execution is framed as some sort of moral loophole, an act of divine justice rather than cowardly revenge. This moral gymnastics is unconvincing, especially when followed by the protagonist’s self-hanging and descent into hell, which plays out like a gothic fever dream stripped of any real emotional payoff. The final image—of eternal torment and a vision of what could have been—is meant to be tragic, but it lands as predictable and shallow.

Ultimately, the story lacks the courage to confront its own themes with honesty. It wants to say something about guilt, faith, justice, and sin, but instead of doing the hard work of dramatizing those ideas, it hides behind abstraction, allegory, and florid language. It’s not a short story—it’s a dressed-up outline for a novel that hasn’t been written yet.
